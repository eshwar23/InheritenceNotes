1) Java supports single , multiple and hybrid inheritance only.

2) In java a class can have at the most one immediate superclass.

3) Every class declared in java is either directly or indirectly a subclass of a class Object , defined in  Java.lang package.

 
 
 Abstract class
 
 Abstract class is the one that simply represents a concept and whose objects cannot be created.
 and it is created through a keyword abstract
 
 Abstract method/function are those with no statement inside the body of the function.
  
 In an abstracct method a semicoln is used at the end of the function
 
 for example :  abstract void display();
 
 The abstract methods of a superclass would require overriding in each subclass , i.e we should srite their definiation in the subclass
